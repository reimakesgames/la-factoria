# Manufacturing Line
A factorio-like game written in Luau and run on Roblox.

## What is this?
It is a factorio-like game with nearly the same gameplay and mechanics.
It could support multiplayer, mods, and responsive performance.

## How to play?
It's just like factorio, you need to build a factory to produce items.
The end goal is to produce a rocket.

There will be some differences between this and factorio, such as:
- There is no pollution (yet).
- There is no biters (yet).
- Game is somewhat 3D.
